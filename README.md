The Document Summarization Assistant is a Python-based web application built with Flask to provide quick summaries of documents. Users can upload PDFs or images, which are processed to extract text using pdfplumber for PDFs and OCR with pytesseract for images. Once the text is extracted, it is sent to Google’s Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash) for summarization. Users can select from three summary lengths: short (2–3 sentences), medium (one paragraph), or long (detailed key points), allowing flexibility depending on the use case.

The frontend uses a clean drag-and-drop interface that dynamically displays the selected file name. Summaries and original text are displayed on a results page. Error handling ensures unsupported file types or extraction failures are clearly communicated.

This project demonstrates the integration of OCR, natural language processing, and generative AI in a practical full-stack application. It enables rapid comprehension of large documents and can be extended with multi-language support or abstractive summarization for more fluent summaries. The assistant is lightweight, user-friendly, and designed for anyone seeking efficient document summarization with minimal setup.
